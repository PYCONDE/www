They help doctors diagnose diseases and develop treatment plans. They tell police officers where to patrol. They decide who is going to be invited to the job interview. It is up to us to ensure that algorithmic systems are designed for the benefit of society. But how do we make sure that the individual and collective freedoms and rights that comprise human rights are strengthened, not undermined, by the use of algorithmic systems?  In the keynote I address the complex interconnections between the technology and society, highlighting potential solutions to understanding, building and regulating algorithm decision making.",

Before applying any algorithm to a data set, discovery and preparation are needed. This hands-on workshop will cover an end-to-end classification project, from importing the data to evaluating a model performance. After this tutorial, you will have completed a step by step Machine Learning workflow.\r\n\r\nPart one: Grab your spade and dig in!\r\nPandas is a popular tool that will allow us to efficiently conduct Exploratory Data Analysis. After loading the data set we\u2019ll use in this workshop, we\u2019ll have a first look at it using Pandas and start cleaning it. We\u2019ll also use visualisation to gain more insights and continue to prepare our data.\r\n\r\nPart two: Where the Ma(th)gic happen.\r\nIn this part, we\u2019ll introduce the scikit-learn library. We'll split the data into training and testing sets and start pre-processing. Then we\u2019ll choose, tune and train a Machine Learning model and finally evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix.\r\n\r\nDuring this workshop, we will fill in a pre-prepared Jupyter notebook together, explaining each step to get a good understanding of the process. You will also have a guided exercise notebook to reinforce your learning on unseen data.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this workshop you will need Python 3, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and jupyter installed. Please refer to the documentation of your operating system of choice or search on the Internet how to install the packages.",

Cool libraries often take a lot of liberty with code structure and make cross-integration difficult, if not impossible. Tests sound ideal, but in practice, they're just so hard to make right. Why is this, and how to change it?\r\n\r\nThe talk will tackle the problems in three parts: \r\n- The Easy Wins: What to do to instantly increase the code quality in your organisation. How? Why isn't it enough?\r\n- Patterns and Antipatterns: How to identify code that \"smells\", how to replace it? How to integrate into old code, better?\r\n- The Philosophy: What approach to set down for the future? Why to care? How to write replace-able code. How to prevent history from repeating.\r\n\r\nThe talk will close with audience discussion and experiences, questions and proposals - building a collection of some on-premise tips and tricks.",

Simulation is an essential tool in this kind of product: it allows to perform regression tests and test new features without the need for real and expensive hardware, to compare the impact of different implementations and optimizations, to inject failures, and more.\r\n\r\nTasks performed by physical robots take time (movement over the warehouse, box lifting, etc.), but in simulation, where virtual robots are used, there is no need to wait all that time. I will describe our implementation of the Discrete-Event Simulation approach which allows us to simulate hours of real-life in minutes.\r\n\r\nShortening simulation time improves the development process by providing faster feedback to developers and quicker CI and testing cycles. Another powerful advantage is a more deterministic simulation - using this approach, each component in the system gets equal opportunity (CPU time) in each time tick, which is not affected by the underlying machine or operating system that the simulation is running on. Also, it is possible to simulate any date and hour easily, and by that we wouldn't panic before the \"Y2K bug\".\r\n\r\nI will elaborate on some challenges we encountered: time leak of event-driven components, differences between dev and production environments and running a distributed simulation due to the transition to microservices.",

Most widely available materials on Python mocks serve as a basic operator\u2019s manual for the library, but scarcely address the code smells and technical debt that mocks may create. \r\n\r\nAn important idea that is commonly misunderstood, is that mocks were never originally intended to simply be a tool for decoupling dependencies.  Mocking originated as a practice with deep roots in OOP and TDD practice, and has a deep catalog of knowledge related to their use and mis-use. \r\n\r\nThis session will trace the origins of mocking in XP, OOP, and TDD and relate it to contemporary practice, to show how developers may be mis-lead.  It will demonstrate some bad code smells related to mocks, as well as alternative solutions.  It is assumed that attendees are already familiar with Python mock, MagicMock, and patch. \r\n\r\nThe content will also serve as an entry point into some more advanced software architecture concepts (test doubles, dependency injection, hexagonal/onion architectures). \r\n\r\nThis knowledge should be useful to engineers or teams who have technical debt related to mocking and patching in their unit tests, but cannot explain why.",

Through its \"define-by-run\" paradigm and pythonesque design it encourages clean, object-oriented code and enables easy debugging by the standard Python debugger.\r\n\r\nEven though these design choices are helpful in research, they impose significant disadvantages on using the model after training is done. Loading your model into an application that might even be written in another programming language is coupled with code refactoring and additional testing.\r\n\r\nTo alleviate these problems, last year PyTorch received a just-in-time compiler (JIT), able to convert your network into a graph-based representation like in TensorFlow. Models that are exported via JIT hide your code, minimize code dependencies and can be loaded into the C++ API of PyTorch. Additionally, JIT optimizes the model code for performance, boosting inference speed.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will have a look at the PyTorch JIT and how to use it. We will investigate its capabilities and limitations on a hands-on example, going over good design choices for your network and how to load your trained model into a C++ application.",

We will describe a problem we recently encountered in time-series extrapolation, where the underlying time-series were (i) non-stationary, (ii) subject to secular shocks ,(iii) short, and (iv) sometimes only indirectly visible. The challenge was to extrapolate the next nine points for each instance.\r\n\r\nOur approach consisted in two stages, an initial analytic stage, for which we used Gaussian process regression to identify intrinsic structure, and a final extrapolation stage, for which we used a custom state-space model motivated by the specific structure we had been able to identify using the GP.  We implemented all the models we used in the Stan probabilistic programming language, which we can access through the PyStan Python package.\r\n\r\nIn our presentation, we will describe the details and motivation of each step (what advantage does a Gaussian process offer in comparision to, e.g., LOESS regression? Why a state-space model, and not an ARMA model?) and the results. We will also compare and contrast our approach with alternatives: e.g., why we do not use a Kalman filter to analyze our model, but instead implement in Stan; why we perform a full marginal analysis of the Gaussian process, rather than taken the better known (older) algebraic approach? We will also describe the supporting processes for the project, and how these interacted with the technical work.",

We cover it end-to-end and first present the basic conceptual ideas and then go into hands-on implementation details.\r\n\r\nIn the conceptual part, we talk about the general approach to the duplicate detection problem and explain how to use both images and texts to identify potential duplicates and how to apply machine learning to make sure the results are accurate. \r\n\r\nTo successfully stop fraudsters, a duplicate detection system has to be able to process millions of items daily while obeying to very strict speed requirements. This is why in the implementation part we discuss how to design the system to sustain high load of 10 million listings daily while always keeping the response time under one second. We show how to build it using python, AWS, elasticsearch, keras and other libraries.",

We will show a few advantages of Julia compared to other languages such as Python (such as its speed, typing in latex code), provide some motivating examples (such as visualising the Julia set (fractals) in comparison to a Python implementation). As a guiding example we will build a Machine Learning neuron that classifies an image as an apple or as a banana using multiple features from the image. We will train the neuron on data from many images; by minimising a loss function using gradient descent the neuron will learn which parameters to pick.\r\nThe participants should bring their laptops; it is not necessary to have installed the latest stable Julia version (v1.0) as we will be using the browser-based version JuliaBox (https://juliabox.com/).",

In this talk I will give you a simple explanation of the basic concepts and their connection with the NLP/NLU world.\r\n\r\nAccording to traditional linguistics, there are 5 levels of study for languages: **phonetics-phonology**, **morphology**, **syntax**, **semantics** and **pragmatics**. They go from the smallest unit in language, the human sounds, to the largest, language usage. We will go through all of them in the talk.\r\n\r\nIn NLP/NLU we use models for different tasks, e.g. , language understanding, topic modelling, sentiment analysis and chatbots. One of those models is the popular word2vec, which produces word embeddings. Each word\u2019s embedding or representation is generated by using the word\u2019s context, or set of nearby words. Pragmatics is used since the representation of the word is given by its context and semantics since each embedding represents the literal meaning of a word. \r\n\r\nAs we can see in this example, word embeddings use multiple linguistic concepts to analyze words. By combining many contextual word mappings a pragmatics based approach is used. A semantics based approach is also used because each mapping represents the literal interpretation of the word.\r\n\r\nWhen we get to understand in which language layer we need to work to reach our goal, then it is easier to recognize the tool we need to use for each task.

I will present different options for automating the feature engineering and selection process in Python with a focus on the open source [`autofeat` library](https://github.com/cod3licious/autofeat), which provides a `scikit-learn` style linear regression model with automated feature engineering and selection capabilities.\r\n\r\nComplex non-linear machine learning models such as neural networks are in practice often difficult to train and even harder to explain to non-statisticians, who require transparent analysis results as a basis for important business decisions. While linear models are efficient and intuitive, they generally provide lower prediction accuracies. The `autofeat` library provides a multi-step feature engineering and selection process, where first a large pool of non-linear features is generated, from which then a small and robust set of meaningful features is selected, which improve the prediction accuracy of a linear model while retaining its interpretability.",

They can learn general language features from unlabeled data, and then be easily fine-tuned for any supervised NLP task, e.g. classification or named entity recognition. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is one example of a language model, pre-trained weights are available for everyone to use. \r\n\r\nBERT has been shown to successfully transfer knowledge from pre-training to many different NLP benchmark tasks. How good can this transfer work for non-English or domain-specific texts, though? \r\n\r\nWe will have a look at how exactly input text is fed to and processed by BERT. Prior knowledge of the BERT architecture is therefore not necessary, but we assume some experience with deep learning and NLP. This introduction gives the background to discuss the limitations you will face when fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT on your data, e.g. related to vocabulary and input text length.  \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution compared to simple fine-tuning is to train your own version of BERT from scratch, thus overcoming some of the discussed limitations. The hope for improving performance is countered by time and hardware requirements that training from scratch brings with it. I was curious enough to give it a try and want to share the findings from this experiment. We will go over the achieved improvements and the actual effort - so you can decide whether you should try to train your own BERT.",

                            "description": "Currently, Machine Learning \u2013 and especially Supervised Learning \u2013 is benefiting heavily from increased automation. This is mainly showing on the fronts of tuning and deployment of models. Automation makes it easier for newcomers to get started. And experienced developers can leverage automation to increase their impact. \r\n\r\nWhile automation of many tasks required for supervised learning is becoming well established, it is less so for the tasks of feature engineering. Feature engineering is one of the most important steps in supervised learning. This is especially true for \u2018classical\u2019 models, such as linear and tree-based ones. But also \u2018deep\u2019 models, which in principle are capable of learning detailed features from data, benefit from being provided with the right features. As of today, engineering good features remains part of the \u2018secret sauce\u2019 of experienced Machine Learning engineers.\r\n\r\nOur talk tackles the question of how well this \u2018secret sauce\u2019 can be automated with off-the-shelf tools available today. We will do this in three steps. First, we will draw today\u2019s map of automation in Supervised Learning, as perceived by us. Second, we will explain the commonly used approaches to automate feature engineering. At this, focus will be on feature extraction from time series analysis via pre-defined temporal patterns, relational operations, and evolutionary algorithms. Finally, we will compare the performance of open-source libraries that implement these approaches, i.e. `tsfresh`, `featuretools`, and `TPOT`.\r\n\r\nFor this comparison, we applied these libraries to a task of Time Series Forecasting. The three mentioned libraries are applied in parts, in comparison, or combined with manual feature engineering. Quality of the produced features is then evaluated by using them with the popular `xgboost` models.\r\n\r\nBeyond education and providing blueprints, we also intend to progress the discussion on the role of automation at our work. To provide evidence and a starting point for collaboration, the code of our comparison will be provided. Together with the community, we would like to find out how useful automation is, what types of work for supervised learning could and should be automated. In general, this is connected to the question of whether automation should remain a *virtual assistance* or if we should expect *full automation* down the road.",

However, the theory behind some of them is still hidden under heavy mathematical jargon, making it difficult for a broader application of them in science and in business.   \r\n\r\nThis tutorial's objective is to introduce you to the concept of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which is a probabilistic framework to work with sequence data, such as speech and language processing and GPS positions. The main idea is to show everyone **What is a HMM** and provide them with sufficient basis so you can use it in your next projects. The concept will be presented with a specific story and application in music:   \r\n  \r\n* \"Given an input music signal, can we identify which chords were played and in which sequence?\"  \r\n\r\nWe will go through a Python [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which will introduce you to the following topics:  \r\n\r\n1. How is sound represented in the computer?\r\n2. Signal Processing 101 - Preprocessing the music signal and feature extraction\r\n3. Introduction to Markov Models\r\n4. Introduction to Hidden Markov Models \r\n\r\nBreak (15 minutes)\r\n\r\n5. Modelling the Chord Recognition problem with HMM\r\n6. Initial Results and Conclusions - \r\n7. General framework for modelling a problem with HMM\r\n\r\nAfter those topics, you'll be able to explain in common language what is a HMM, how it works and mainly, how you can use it next time you work with sequence data.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to know python, but you'll be able to engage more with the workshop in case you have at least the basics of it. Lastly, we'll talk about some mathematical concepts, such as probabilities and probability densities but, if you are just interested in the mixture of mathematics, programming and music, this tutorial will be for you! \r\n\r\nThe notebook and slides will be shared on [Github](https://github.com/) and, for the presentation day, the notebook will be virtually shared with [My Binder](https://mybinder.org), so everyone can execute it by themselves.",

And who cares?**            \r\n\r\n* OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is the discipline of gathering intelligence from publicly available sources for empowering end-user action.\r\n\r\n* Originating as a statecraft tool, broadening use of OSINT has demonstrated it\u2019s potential for social impact, as evidenced by the work of citizen and research organisations like Bellingcat and The Human Rights Centre at UC Berkeley in exposing crimes against humanity.         \r\n \r\n**Current challenges & limitations**        \r\n\r\n* Lack of Modernisation: OSINT\u2019s lagging adaption to contemporary open source landscapes has created persistent operational deficiencies, as made apparent by Western Intelligence agencies\u2019 failure to predict the social-media mobilised Arab Spring uprisings.     \r\n\r\n* Disinformation & Volumes of Data: public digital platforms are increasingly an information battleground between facts and alternative facts, as Industry 3.0\u2019s advancing democratisation of technology facilitates User-Generated Content by good and bad actors alike. And this noisy Big Data challenge is set to scale dramatically with additional AI-Generated Content and IoT sensor data in the 5G Industry 4.0 era.     \r\n\r\n**Opportunities for improvement**          \r\n\r\n* In these complex conditions both possibilities and hurdles have never been higher. This talk focuses on tackling the hurdle of overdue modernisation.  \r\n\r\n* We present a socio-technical maturity model that uses Python to update legacy OSINT practices to better investigate today's disinformation activities, emphasising the advantages but also necessities of adopting 21st century capabilities for effective open source reconnaissance.  \r\n\r\n**Goal**            \r\n\r\n* We share this topic for public interest, the real-world Python use-case, and to incentivise the community to get into ethical OSINT hacking!",

Advantages and limitations of this approach as compared to Cython or wrapping Fortran, C or C++ are also discussed.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we introduce the [vtext](https://github.com/rth/vtext) project that allows fast text processing in Python using Rust. In particular, we consider the problems of text tokenization, and (parallel) token counting resulting in a sparse vector representation of documents. These can then be used as input in machine learning or information retrieval applications. We outline the approach used in vtext and compare to existing solutions of these problems in the Python ecosystem.",

An efficient and scalable way to store big data is by using object stores of public cloud providers like ABS, S3 or GCS. These storages come with downsides attached which make the management of tabular data distributed over many objects not a trivial task.\r\n\r\n[Kartothek](https://github.com/JDASoftwareGroup/kartothek) is a recently open sourced Python library we develop and use at [Blue Yonder \u2013 JDA Software](https://tech.jda.com) to manage tabular data in cloud object stores. It is built on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org), [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) and is powered by [Dask](http://dask.org). It\u2019s specification is compatible with the de-facto standard storage layouts used by other big data processing tools like Apache Spark and Hive but offers a native, seamless integration into the Python ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWhat Kartothek offers, includes:\r\n* Consistent dataset state at all times.\r\n* Add or remove files with an atomic operation.\r\n* Read without any locking mechanisms.\r\n* Strongly typed and enforced table schemas using Apache Arrow.\r\n* `O(1)` remote storage calls to plan job dispatching.\r\n* Inverted indices for fast and efficient querying.\r\n* Integrated predicate pushdown on row group level using Apache Parquet.\r\n* Seamless integration to pandas, Dask and the Python ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, I want you to leave with the knowledge about what the struggles in modern big data storage are and how to deal with them.",

This talk is pitched at intermediate, but for beginners extensive documentation and a github repo will be available to read and learn from.\r\n\r\n## What is it about ##\r\nThe story of a project to capture data for the purpose of using in AI projects, which then became an OS platform with innovative ideas more important that the original concept. A multimode sensor platform using Augmented Reality for visualization.\r\n\r\n## Will I See The Real Prototype ##\r\nYes there will be a demonstration of the prototype and this will be used as part of the talk to explain the concepts.\r\n\r\n## What Technologies Will It Cover ##\r\nThis talk will cover a microcontroller with plug-able sensors using (micropython)[http://www.micropython.org/] for the main software development platform. For the serve side components the talk will be using a micro web server used to serve sensor data and a simple AR display.\r\nFor Augmented Reality the talk will switch to using HTML and JavaScript needed to render objects in the browser for the demo.\r\n\r\n## What Will I Learn ##\r\nHopefully you will learn an introduction to IoT concepts to developers who are interested in this tech, but we will use python for embedded systems and show how to used. You will see in this talk:\r\n* How to use a tiny microcontroller with real sensors using (micropython)[http://www.micropython.org/].\r\n* How to connect 'things' to the platform.\r\n* A micro web server to serve content.\r\n* The web side, using web technologies like A-Frame, AR.js for the purpose of having AR capabilities.\r\n\r\n## In Summary ##\r\nThis talk will cover going from the small embedded world of IoT and sensors using python. Some time will be given to go over the general micro server. Then the last part of the talk will go over the concepts of Augmented Reality and using a mobile browser to view data from the sensors.\r\n\r\n### Resources ###\r\nThe main github repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/SamsungResearchUK-IoT-Meetup/multimode_sensor_platform). However there will be nothing much to view till near the time of the talk.",

What is it you ask? We will explain it to you and also introduce other useful tools in open source project. For example, CICD tools like Travis and documentation service like ReadTheDocs and testing using Pytest.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we will show you how to prepare release: Signing up an account on PyPI (and it\u2019s testing clone), using setuptools to make the wheels, uploading to the test site and test pip installing your package. This will eventually leads you to uploading to the PyPI and thus releasing your package.\r\n\r\nAt the end, I will also share some tips of how to get people involved and do the marketing bit.This is the bit which is the same as running a start up, getting the \u2018crowd funding\u2019 of people\u2019s contribution and engagement. We may have some stickers for you but we won\u2019t guarantee.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for anyone that has some experience coding with Python but not much experience in software development. I hope this talk will encourage more people to be involved in open source contribution.",

New contributors face less barriers when contributing to Python. Core developers are benefiting from personal assistants in the form of GitHub bots and automations.\r\nCan the workflow be even better? In this talk, we'll look into other problems in CPython's workflow: the issue tracker itself.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of PEP 581, by Python steering council means that another big workflow change is impending. Let's hear about some of the proposed plans on improving CPython's workflow, and learn how you can help and take part in this process.",

It can be very demotivating. This talk is not about downplaying this feeling but it is about demonstrating a lovely hack; understanding a mother algorithm. \r\n\r\nIt turns out that if you appreciate what the gaussian distribution can do then there are lot's of algorithms that are much easier to grasp. This talk is an attempt at explaining the power of the Gaussian[tm] by stepping up the ladder of complexity of algorithms:\r\n\r\n- Naive Bayes \r\n- Mixture Naive Bayes \r\n- Gaussian Mixture Models \r\n- Outlier Detectors \r\n- Neural Mixture Models \r\n- Gaussian Auto Embeddings \r\n- Gaussian Processes\r\n\r\nThe talk will contain maths, but they will all be (more than) compensated with xkcd-style images.

To have a baseline for comparison, the classical method of Gaussian Processes for regression problems is presented. I then elaborate on different DL methods for uncertainty quantification like Quantile Regression, Monte-Carlo Dropout, and Deep Ensembles. The talk is concluded with a comparison of these techniques to Gaussian Processes and the current state of the art.",

Tools for build automatisation, continuous integration, code review, etc help software engineers follow established best practices. In contrast, many of us data scientists have taken to building our own tools for things like managing experiments, for tracking data, for enabling reproducibility. Of course, writing such tools is **hard** and takes a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nFortunately, the good news is: more and more software supporting data science best practices is becoming available to us. From stand-alone packages such as DVC, polyaxon to Software as a Service solutions such as floydhub, valohai. The bad news is: there really are **a lot** of these tools around and it is hard to know which one to go with. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I want to show you, how readily available tools can help you follow best practices in data science. I will focus on the model development phase of a data science project, I will not be talking about tooling for model deployment. I will start with an overview of available tools and will then do a deep-dive comparison of 2-3 tools and show how they support you with things like\r\n\r\n* Versioning data\r\n* Tracking which data / code / library versions / parameters are used in which experiment\r\n* Easily comparing / visualising experiment results\r\n* Enabling everybody in your team / future you to replicate experiments\r\n\r\nI will also compare them on non-technical dimensions such as\r\n\r\n* Ease of use / collaboration\r\n* Price (especially for SaaS solutions)\r\n* Vendor lock-in\r\n\r\nAfter this talk you should have a good idea of which tools already are available and which things you can/should look for when deciding if a tool is right for your project.",

(Can be done via desktop app, check Preferences section. After setting up, restart Docker App)\r\n* **Download the Airflow Docker image**: `docker pull puckel/docker-airflow`\r\n* Download repository under the `$HOME` directory.\r\n`git clone https://github.com/deliveryhero/pyconde2019-airflow-ml-workshop`",

Therefore, despite recent awareness, auditing for bias and fairness when developing and deploying AI systems is not yet a standard practice. In this tutorial, we present Aequitas(http://github.com/dssg/aequitas), an open source bias and fairness audit toolkit that is an intuitive and easy to use addition to the machine learning workflow, enabling users to seamlessly test models for several bias\r\nand fairness metrics in relation to multiple population sub-groups. Aequitas facilitates informed and equitable decisions around developing and deploying algorithmic decision making systems for both data scientists, machine learning researchers and policymakers.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial we will cover the following how tos: \r\n*How to think about fairness and equity when building and evaluating AI systems;* *How to define fairness goals and manage efficiency and effectiveness tradeoffs;* *How to select fairness metrics;* *How to build and select ML models that achieve those fairness goals; * *How to validate that the AI system is fair*;*How to monitor a deployed AI system for fairness and adapt if necessary;*",

Furthermore, docker-compose (formerly known as Fig) is entirely written in python. This may lead to the impression, that docker and python is pure love and a match made in heaven. While for some use-cases this is true. But local development of python code inside a docker container is surprisingly broken, at least if you want to do it right. \r\nIn this talk I will walk you through the proper setup of a local python development environment using docker.

We will start with a quick introduction how Python executes code, focusing on stack frames and tracebacks. Then we will give an overview of different tools and techniques to debug Python if you get an error or unexpected output, ranging from pdb in the terminal to ipdb in Jupyter to the visual debugger in PyCharm and VS Code.",

In this talk, I will argue why knowing this uncertainty can be valuable. This especially applies if your ML model is used to minimize some kind of cost - either implicitly by a human or explicitly by an optimization algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe first step in realizing this value is going beyond point estimators towards predicting a probability distribution. In this talk, I will review how this can be done with `scikit-learn` and related tools.\r\n\r\nThe second step is feeding these predictions into an optimization algorithm as probability distributions. As an example, I will present grocery store orders that are calculated from demand predictions. In extreme cases, including the uncertainty of the ML predictions turns out to be necessary for the optimization to be useful in practice at all.",

The extension mechanism lets third-party developers write their own extensions and contribute back to the Jupyter ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThere is now a growing number of these extensions which provide IDE-like features such as: git integration, code formatting, table of content, diagram editor, and many more.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this presentation is to complement the online documentation by doing a demo of a curated list of these JupyterLab extensions. All happening in JupyterLab.\r\n\r\nLayout:\r\n\r\n- Introduction to JupyterLab extensions: what are they and why are they useful? [5 min]\r\n- Demo of 20 JupyterLab extensions in 20 minutes [20 min]\r\n- What's next and questions? [5 min]\r\n\r\nThere will also be a GitHub repository with all the dependencies and extensions, ready to be tried out right away on [Binder](https://mybinder.org).",

This builds prior knowledge about our data (_e.g._ orientation should not influence prediction) into network itself which therefore no longer needs to be learned through data augmentation. In addition to that, these new networks  achieve a significant reduction in sample complexity and a notable increase in performance, generally converge faster and prove far more effective in cases of class imbalance. The GrouPy convolution layer can simply be used as a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions. \r\n\r\nAs a use case, we study lung nodule detection - suspicious lesions in the lung visible on a 3D CT chest scan that may be indicative of lung cancer. We learn that using networks with these new convolutions achieve an increase in performance even when trained on 10x less data.",

Even with the greatest care, there will always be things you wish to change later on. But since other people's code relies on your API, mistakes cannot be undone easily. Luckily, Python is quite flexible - allowing for various changes while keeping backward compatibility. But even when a breaking change is required there are ways to achieve this with the least possible pain for authors and users.\r\n\r\nSuitable transition strategies depend on the reach of your code. Therefore, we'll look at various real-world examples from core python over public open source libraries to company-internal code. These examples will give you practical patterns you can apply in your code. Additionally, we'll see how code can be written in the first place so that later changes are easier.",

Instead, projects are increasingly expected to produce interactive tools to allow end-users to explore data and results with rich, interactive visualizations. Inevitably, this will be done in a web browser, meaning you'll need to add a quantitatively trained web developer to your team, or have your data scientists spend time learning HTML, Javascript and CSS. Dash, a project by the team that makes Plotly, solves some of these problems by allowing data scientists to build rich and interactive websites in pure python, with minimal knowledge of HTML and absolutely no Javascript.\r\n\r\nAt decisionLab, a London-based data science consultancy producing decision tools, we've embraced Dash to produce proof-of-concept models for our projects in alpha. Although we're not officially connected to the plotly/Dash project, by using the library daily across many projects, we've learned many lessons and what we feel are best practises we'd like to share, and hear feedback on!\r\n\r\nThis talk will give an overview of Dash, how it works and what it can be used for, before outlining some of the common problems that emerge when data scientists are let loose to produce web applications, and web developers have to work with the pydata ecosystem. The talk also covers effective working practises to start producing cool interactive statistical web applications, fast. We'll also identify some of the pitfalls of Dash, and how and when to make the decision to stop using Dash and start building a proper web application.",

FOBO gives a name to that spiral we fall into when we obsessively research every possible option when faced with a decision, fearing we\u2019ll miss out on the \u201cbest\u201d one.\r\nWhen starting a new machine learning project, just the thought and the reality that we'll never be able to examine every possible algorithm, package, tool and/or technology before making a decision can be overwhelming and it can easily block us. What if we make the wrong decision and don't bring enough value? What if what we choose to use isn't \"state-of-the-art\"?\r\nThe first solutions that come to mind are often the \u201cmost-hyped\u201d options, for example DL, although those are not always the best fitting ones. How should you decide what to use? \r\n\r\nWe will present a practical roadmap to guide your Data Science projects: What to focus on first (probably, it\u2019s cleaning data and feature engineering), which algorithms to try first (hint: not NNs!!) and tips for convincing business leaders to focus on what works, not on the hype.",

After some practice, implementing a new endpoint starts to be a trivial task; no major complexities and turns out to be really repetitive.\r\n\r\nWhile adding an endpoint might seem an easy task, sometimes you need to slightly update an already existing endpoint. When editing, the risk of negatively affect your users is just around the corner. Previously deployed applications, due to changes in the communication interface, are at risk of misbehaving, crashing, etc.\r\n\r\nHave you ever changed an endpoint without knowing that previous versions of your clients would be broken or have you ever got so close to it? If you're answering yes ... then you\u2019ve probably experienced backward incompatible changes.\r\n\r\nAt Yelp, we developed an open source tool that helps us detect breaking changes in the Swagger specs before getting any closer to production.\r\nWe modify our specs pretty often (more than 2-3 times a day) and preventing such changes is critical for the health of our services and our client experiences.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will see how you can leverage the tool to protect your specs, API, and services from backward incompatible changes.",

                            "description": "Over the last decade Jupyter notebooks have become an incredibly powerful tool for performing analyses and visualizing data. Once an analysis is done it often has to be shared with a wider audience, either within an organization or with the wider public, but this step often requires an entirely different set of tools and skillset. [Panel](http://panel.pyviz.org) is a new, open-source Python library built to easily wrap the outputs of an analysis, combine them with widgets and then lay them out as an interactive app or dashboard. This enables faster iteration cycles within organizations and ensures users without in-depth familiarity with web programming can develop and deploy complex dashboards with minimal code. \r\n\r\nPanel natively supports a wide range of plotting tools and many other types of data making it trivial to work with the tools users are already familiar with. A complex interactive Panel-based dashboard is typically many times shorter than the equivalent [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) or [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) code, focusing on expressing relationships between widgets, computation, and visualizations directly. At the same time Panel is not limited to building simple apps and can be used to visualize complex, multi-stage analysis pipelines, provides full styling flexibility using CSS and Bokeh themes and has the ability to dynamically resize to the size of the browser window.\r\n\r\nOnce an application is built either in a Python script or notebook it can trivially be deployed as a standalone app using Bokeh Server without any change in behavior. Alternatively, Panel apps can be exported to static HTML files by defining Javascript based interactions or even recording and embedding the app's state space, making it possible to share interactive visualizations as self-contained files. \r\n\r\nIn the talk we will discover some of the core ideas behind Panel, go through the process of making an existing Jupyter notebook deployable as a dashboard and finally look at a number of case studies of more complex dashboards. With Panel, your analyses and visualizations can now very easily leap from your notebook into the real world!",

On the other hand, many data scientists are willing to dedicate some spare time to do something meaningful. Data Science for Social Good Berlin acts as an intermediary to connect data scientists and nonprofits to address the social issues of our time. Several event formats are used to help nonprofits with small and large data projects. \r\nIn this talk, we will present DSSG Berlin, its mission, its working structure as a nonprofit organisation itself, and the different events we are running.

It has a very nice API and many tools are built around it, but its support for neural networks is very limited.\r\n\r\n[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a deep learning platform that makes working with neural networks a blast. However, users often find that they need to write boilerplate and wrapper code to integrate PyTorch into their existing workflows.\r\n\r\nA possible solution to those problems is [skorch](https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch). This open source Python library allows you to easily wrap your PyTorch modules to give them a high level sklearn API. This allows you to:\r\n\r\n* tap into the power and flexibility of PyTorch\r\n* get rid of most of the boring boilerplate code\r\n* combine PyTorch nets with the usual sklearn goodies like `Pipeline`s, `GridSearchCV`, etc.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you already have some basic knowledge of sklearn and PyTorch, or are an advanced user of one of the two libraries who is curious about improving your workflow.",

Evolotuinory ecologists are interested in animals\u2019 adaptive evolution of behavioural strategies. Neuroscientists focus on brain-behaviour relationships to investigate how the brain learns new movements or how the brain tells the body to move. To get to bottom of behaviour, evolutionary ecologists survey animals\u2019 adaptive evolution of behavioural strategies. Anciently, in order to quantify animal movement and behaviour, direct observations were made in the field. However direct observations bear several problems. They are not only time-consuming and labour intensive but also tendentious which often leads to difficulty in reproducing the experiments. Moreover, the presence of the observer can affect the behaviour of the animals if animals are not accustomed to the observer. These issues may be overcome by using a video recording system. Unlike the direct observation which cannot be reanalyzed in the case that the fatigue of the observer, video recording ensures complete and permanent registration of behavioural patterns which happened during the observation time. \r\n\r\nHowever, analyzing the video recordings from a traditional point of view with a pencil, paper and stopwatch induced problems like time consumption and human labour. The recent technological development in the field of computer vision has allowed researchers to track the animals automatically. With the help of the automated tracking techniques, less time and effort is needed to generate a precise dataset of animal movement and behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhile different commercial animal tracking programs are available, those are relatively expensive and can\u2019t be adapted for more specific use cases. There are also different Open Source programs available, but these projects are often abandoned and could most of the time just be considered in a proof of concept stage. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I want to show how to easily integrate existing Open Source technologies, such as *Python*, *OpenCV*, *Seaborn* and *Jupyter* in order to track the movement of pigeons in a labyrinth. I also want to encourage scientists without a computer science background to get in touch with the Open Source mindset.",

In this talk I talk about recent events around the scikit-learn community, and how it has affected the development cycle. I will also cover some of the recent major activities on the project, and the major features we're actively working on. There are also other major developments on the roadmap that I'll briefly discuss.\r\n\r\nOther than the core scikit-learn package, there are many other packages included in the scikit-learn-contrib organization mostly maintained by their own developers. There is also a scikit-learn-extra package which includes some models and methods which do not pass the inclusion criteria of scikit-learn. I will cover how these packages are handled and included, and how one can propose a package or a new model to be included in these libraries.",

However, this format underpins an essential tension between the format's implied linearity and the computer's ability to access, process, and display information in any order. Functional approaches offer an idiosyncratic way of navigating the issue. For example, treating a cell as a collection of small pure functions and eliminating mutable global state make results more immediate and errors easier to understand.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain functional programming using practical language and provide historical context. Some initial concepts will be demonstrated in Clojure or Julia, but ultimately translated to Python. Further consideration will be given to the impact of immutability, a core concept in the functional style, on creating reproducible notebooks.\r\n\r\nDon't get bit by misaligned state and output, keep your notebooks running with these functional tips!",

However, the design of algorithms and handling of inputs and outputs will all be done via conventional programming. There are now a handful of frameworks being built to meet this need, and all but one are based on Python.\r\n\r\nThis session will serve as an introduction to quantum computing as a whole, and also to the most well-developed and well-used framework built to support it: Qiskit.\r\n\r\nTo introduce quantum computing I will explain what a quantum circuit is, and what it means to create programs at the level of a quantum circuit. This will be done with a presentation based on our Jupyter notebook based [textbook](https://community.qiskit.org/textbook/). This presentation will give a simple demonstration of how the variables of quantum computing are fundamentally different than those of standard computing\r\n\r\nTo provide a simple sandbox for experimentation, the tutorial will be explicitly based on the MicroPython version of Qiskit. Examples will be run on PewPews, the microcontroller-based games console used for teaching Python. So if you have a PewPew from this year's EuroPython, bring it along!\r\n\r\n*Goals:*\r\n* Help people get ready for the coming quantum revolution.\r\n* Show that quantum computing is something any Python user can mess around with.\r\n\r\n*What problem is this talk addressing*: Quantum computing is now easy to access for any Python user. The problem is, many may assume that it is only for those with a PhD in physics.\r\n\r\n*Why is the problem relevant to the audience*: All fields of computing will be affected when quantum computing reaches it's full potential. Now is the time for everyone to start exploring what it can do for them.\r\n\r\n*What is(are) your solution(s) to the problem*: By hosting a practical session with accessible examples of quantum computing, I hope to show the audience that they can use it too.\r\n\r\n*What are the main takeaways from your talk*: How to use a quantum computer, and why you'd want to.",

This means that you don't need to say what a given variable will hold, or whether your function will return a string or an integer (or sometimes one, and sometimes another!). This has historically made Python a very flexible and beginner-friendly language.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages to a static type system, as well as recent efforts to introduce static typing to Python via optional \"type hints\" and various tools to aid in adding types to Python code. We'll see what this means for Python, for Python programmers, and what the future has in store for Python's type system.\r\n\r\n# Audience\r\n\r\nThis talk is for Python programmers who either don't know what static typing is, don't know why why they might want it, or who do have some understanding, but aren't sure what benefits they might get by adding type annotations to their code.\r\n\r\nAttendees should know that there is a distinction between typed and untyped code, and understand what some types (list, int, string, etc) are, but don't need to know exactly what static typing is or have direct experience with typed code.\r\n\r\nAfter watching this talk, attendees should understand that Python is untyped by default but can be typed. They should understand the class of problems that adding type annotations seeks to alleviate, and some tools they can use to add and check type annotations.\r\n\r\n# Outline\r\n\r\n* About types\r\n    * Types of type systems\r\n    * Advantages of static typing\r\n    * Disadvantages of static typing\r\n* Types in other languages\r\n    * C\r\n    * Ruby\r\n    * JavaScript\r\n    * Go\r\n* Types in Python\r\n    * How Python did/does typing\r\n    * The `type` function\r\n    * PEP 484: Type Hints\r\n    * The `typing` module\r\n    * Tools\r\n        * mypy\r\n        * pytype\r\n* The great benefits to static typing in Python\r\n    * Static code analysis\r\n    * More documentation\r\n    * Code completion\r\n* The disadvantages to static typing\r\n* The challenges of static typing",

                            "description": "A common problem in mathematical finance is the evaluation of exercise options (enter or cancel rights) in financial contracts. A typical example is an American equity option that allows the investor at any given day to buy (or sell) a stock at a fixed price. The owner has to decide every day whether to exercise the option or to hold it and exercise later. Another example is a corporate bond that can be canceled by the issuer at several dates before its maturity. More general, a situation where a company or an investor can opt in or opt out of a business or contract can be framed as an exercise option.\r\n\r\nUsing Monte Carlo simulation, many financial products can be evaluated with low computational effort. However, when an exercise option comes into play, for every path of the original simulation an additional full simulation would be required to price the exercise right. With every exercise right added, the computational effort increases exponentially and the full revaluation approach quickly becomes unfeasible. Francis Longstaff and Eduardo Schwartz developed a simple method based on linear least-squares to tackle this problem. Instead of recursive full simulations, the exercise option value is estimated by performing successive linear regressions on predefined basis functions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, a simple implementation of the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm in Python will be presented. The technical problems in the context of exercise right valuation are explained using code examples. Prerequisites are intermediate Python skills and a solid foundation in probability theory and statistics (especially probability distributions, stochastic processes and linear regression). Knowledge on quantitative finance or financial markets is not expected, but will certainly be useful. The SciPy technology stack will be used for the implementation of the algorithm.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk you will be familiar with a simple method to evaluate exercise options and determine optimal exercise decisions. Also, you will know how to implement this method using Python.",

These environments are of interest to researchers investigating the interaction between music and social behaviour.  Silent discos are a dance club-like environment with one great advantage: a signal in the form of headphone lights. Using overhead video capture and image processing, these headphone lights can be used to track people\u2019s location over time.\r\n\r\nThese methods provide a low-cost alternative to motion tracking laboratories, which are expensive to set-up and maintain. Since silent discos have become increasingly popular at festivals and other events, they also present a relatively natural environment in which larger groups of people can participate.\r\n\r\nFor this project, I built upon Python's OpenCV library to detect locations of dancers in a silent disco, using their headphone lights as a proxy.

In this talk, I will talk about an approach for a matrix completion problem that learns a distribution of data where information is incomplete or collecting it has a cost. Active learning is a method of analyzing the observed data such that choosing the next observation will give the most information about the variable to be predicted. However, when observations are costly, one needs strategies to obtain informative data to arrive at accurate predictions with less data. I will show results for comparing various observation sequence selection strategies on the matrix completion problem. We used Gibbs Sampling and Variational Bayes as inference mechanisms on the MovieLens dataset. For this study, we totally use the Python programming language. I will also show our results using Python Heatmap.",

For example, you could understand a code\r\nsection by reading it carefully, but a summary comment can make\r\nthis a lot easier, although such a comment is a \"what comment\"\r\nrather than a \"why comment.\"\r\n\r\nHow much commenting is needed doesn't depend on the code alone.\r\nAs the talk discusses, this depends on the experience of the team\r\nmembers and their fluctuation. Note that \"experience\" is much\r\nmore complex than you may think. For example, the term can apply\r\nto general programming experience, domain knowledge - or several\r\nother aspects of \"experience.\"\r\n\r\nAn important part of the talk is how to comment in order to help\r\nreaders of the code.

What seems like an easy question quickly gets more complex if we ask ourselves when A played B for the last time, what the scores were and whether or not B's grandmother had died just before the match. The question of correctly ranking contestants has been around as long as people have been playing sports, and it doesn't lose its relevance. In online video games, rankings are used to build teams of fair skill. In betting, ranking directly translates to the probability of a contestant winning the match. And of course every chess player world wide can tell you their Elo rating.\r\nIn this talk we will look at the most established ranking algorithms: Elo, Glicko2 and Trueskill. All three are based on Bayesian updating. We will consider the theoretical foundation of the three, and compare their use cases and shortcomings. All the three algorithms are readily available as Python packages. Using a real-life data set we will generate a ranking of German Bundesliga teams and compare it to the currently accepted status quo.",

A recent set of *hardware description libraries*, several based in Python, aim to instead move the chip-design process into modern programming languages. \r\n\r\nThese developments ride alongside a complementary rise in prominence of the open-source RISC-V instruction set, enabling Python implementations of fully open-source CPUs and SOCs.  \r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the primary libraries in this space, chips being built with them, and likely future directions for Python's role in silicon design.",

As we discuss governance and ethics in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we should also acknowledge that society as a whole lacks technical expertise on both, the law and machine learning. We should also acknowledge that the concept of ethics is not easily digestible and that we struggle consistently to reach a broad consensus on what is right and what is wrong with respect to various topics ranging from business practices to abortion. It will require a sustained effort of experts from both communities to make sure that legal and ethical frameworks for machine learning are effective while minimizing the impact on the effectiveness of machine learning. Due to the speaker\u2019s legal community bias the talk will focus on illuminating the legal perspective and existing framework first and the ethical perspective second while trying to reflect as much machine learning knowledge as possible, which the speaker has sought to accumulate over the last two years, and hopefully input from the audience.",

They keep track of what was changed in a file, when and by whom, and synchronize changes to a central server so that multiple contributors can manage changes to the same set of files. But these **traditional tools aren\u2019t quite sufficient for Machine Learning** because of the need for being able to **track the data sets along with the code itself and some of the resulting models**.\r\n\r\nSo versioning in Data Science projects can be pretty painful. There are generally six things that you usually want to keep track of:\r\n* code\r\n* data\r\n* configurations\r\n* resulting models\r\n* performance metrics\r\n* environments / dependencies\r\n\r\nRunning a Data Science project is an iterative process and you usually don\u2019t want to commit changes every time you change one parameter or one performance metric. Instead, you'll run a variety of experiments and commit it once you\u2019re satisfied.\r\n\r\nThis usually means that during the experimentation process, you might lose track of any of the experiments that you did (e.g. changes on data or dependencies). However, when you share your results with your colleagues, they'll not have any ideas of what you've already tried and most likely will end up redoing a bunch of work \u2014 heck, after a couple of weeks you could end up doing the same.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will share some best practices to help you better version your ML project and also I will show some existing tools such as [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [ndim](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) and [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/) (to version Jupyter Notebooks).\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at PyData beginners and specific Machine Learning expertise is not required, although knowledge about Git and the Data Science ecosystem would help follow the speech.",

A lot of the difficulties of supervised and unsupervised learning are simply not an issue here, but it comes at a cost of dealing with a completely different set of problems. \r\n\r\nWe have seen the tremendous success of RL in creating AIs for various games - from tic-tac-toe through chess and Go and up to Starcraft 2 and Dota 2. But what about successful applications in fields that are not inherently game-related? Turns out, we won\u2019t find that many, even if we dig pretty deep. Why is that?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s due to the prevalence of problems that are inherent to the current state of RL as a field. In this talk we will address these limitations. We will see that many of the reported findings don\u2019t hold up under scrutiny. We will see how and why many state-of-the-art algorithms break down when compared to much more simple solutions. However, we will also identify the conditions where RL already shines or might shine in the future. In the end we will discuss some promising avenues for future research.\r\n\r\nThe talk assumes a familiarity with fundamental principles of machine learning in general as well as a basic knowledge of reinforcement learning concepts specifically (not to waste time on introducing the common terminology).",

Numba's just-in-time compilation ability makes it easy to interactively experiment with GPU computing in the Jupyter notebook. Combining Numba with CuPy, a nearly complete implementation of the NumPy API for CUDA, creates a high productivity GPU development environment. Learn the basics of using Numba with CuPy, techniques for automatically parallelizing custom Python functions on arrays, and how to create and launch CUDA kernels entirely from Python.

Once you have built a model, you also need to deploy it to a production system, monitor its performance, and continuously retrain it on new data and compare with alternative models. A possible solution to managing this complexity is offered by **MLFlow**. MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. \r\n\r\nThis tutorial showcases how you can use MLflow end-to-end to:\r\n* Train models and *keep track* of experiments with **MLflow Tracking**\r\n* Package the code that trains the model in a *reusable and reproducible* model format with **MLFlow Projects**\r\n* *Deploy* the model into a HTTP server that will enable you to score predictions with **MLFlow Models**",

Characteristic of such legacy systems is that the knowledge used to arrive at the discount incentive is locked away, not only inside the case worker, but also the unstructured documents they produce.\r\n\r\nExample unstructured documents include:  \r\n\r\na)\tticketing system documents: containing the expert\u2019s rationale; instructions for handling accounts, and alternative strategies to offer debtors\r\nb)\tlegacy code: containing plain text rules \r\nc)\tscanned  letters: containing monetary incentive offered to a debtor and agreement conditions received from the debtor\r\nd)\temail exchange with the debtor and case worker\r\n\r\nProblem: Although a legacy system continues to bring value to the business they have several limitations:\r\n\r\n1)\tNot Scalable:   Legacy systems do not scale. The potential individuals that can be helped with the burden of debt is limited by the amount of cases a worker can process\r\n2)\tUntune-able with Automated Optimized: It is not possible to experimentally optimize the amount of payment discount such that a favorable amount is offered to the debtor, yet minimize loss for the business \r\n3)\tLack Fairness: The bias of the case worker is baked into the discount. A human decides the terms and conditions of the discount and the system may be influenced by bias due to age or gender of debtor, season of the year, or human error.\r\n\r\nSolution: We overcome the aforementioned limitations by modernizing a legacy, German-language rule-based system. We re-encode the rules of a rule-based system and use open source tools including: Tesseract and SpaCy to extract Machine Learning features from  heterogenous documents (pdf, tickets, emails, etc). We present a case study which uses AI Fairness 360 to build  tunable, Bias-Minimizing AI solutions that are capable of offering personalized, payment discounts to debtors. \r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn techniques for building an Information Extraction pipeline from images and unstructured German text. You will also learn about the pitfall and successes from a case study to build a bias-mitigating AI solution for debt repayment.",

These are all big words, but in Python all this comes quite natural. Getting started with these things is not too hard and can be done in an incremental fashion.\r\n\r\nTo get to the essential ideas of how metaprogramming can help in creating a testing framework we will look at:\r\n\r\n* Automatic test discovery and execution. What happens when I run `pytest path/to/my/tests`?\r\n* Selecting marked tests via expressions (`@pytest.mark`). How do I implement `@pytest.mark.<arbitrarily_named_marker>` and run `pytest -m` with an expression to select specific tests decorated with markers?\r\n* Automatic dependency injection (`@pytest.fixture`). How do I implement a fixture mechanism and what happens if I use a fixture in my test?\r\n\r\nThis is an introductory talk. No knowledge is expected of either pytest or metaprogramming. The functionality will be explained and built from the ground up for each feature. This is also a very code heavy talk, but It turns out that if you don't have to worry about the real world, you only need a few lines of code as Python itself does the heavy lifting :)\r\n\r\nA more complete version of the code shown in the talk lives in the [pico-pytest repository](https://gitlab.com/obestwalter/pico-pytest)). it contains an installable, tested project that also implements only the bare functionality, but has automatic tests and makes use of type hinting (these are especially useful in programs that are very dynamic and make use of metaprogramming).\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: no third party tools where harmed in the making of this talk: metaprogramming is inbuilt into Python and well supported by the language and its standard library.",

Why these loss functions can be used for machine learning at all, and when you should consider an alternative? No? Great! This talk is for you. \r\n\r\nThe talk begins with a recap on the definition of loss functions in the context of gradient descent, followed by a short introduction to maximum likelihood estimation using a practical example. As the talk proceeds, it is shown how to derive mean squared error and cross correlation from Gaussian- and  multinoulli distributions, which allows us to identify potential limitations of the two loss functions. The remaining time is used to relate these findings into the broader context of machine learning, with especial regard to neuronal networks.\r\n\r\nThe talk should be useful for those getting started with machine learning, as well as for practitioners that desire a theory recap.

By eliminating the need to collect data at a central location, yet still enabling each participant to benefit from the collective knowledge of all participants in the network, it lets you build intelligent applications that leverage insights from data that might be too costly, sensitive, or impractical to collect.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate how you can develop hands-on familiarity with federated learning using TensorFlow Federated (TFF), a new open-source framework in the TensorFlow ecosystem. We will introduce the key concepts behind TensorFlow and TFF, we\u2019ll demonstrate by example how to setup a federated learning experiment and run it in a simulator, what the code looks like under the hood and how to extend it, and we\u2019ll briefly discuss options for future deployment to real devices.\r\n\r\nThe talk caters to audiences with different types of backgrounds:\r\n\r\nMachine learning developers and practitioners, who would like to experiment with running their existing machine learning models and data in a federated setting, will learn how to do so using Federated Learning API, the included simulation runtime and sample federated data sets.\r\n\r\nResearchers, who would like to experiment with new types of federated learning algorithms or extend those that come included with the framework, or who might wish to develop custom types of federated computations such as statistical analysis over sensitive data, will learn how to do so using Federated Core API, a strongly-typed functional programming environment that allows for easy mixing of TensorFlow code with federated communication abstractions.\r\n\r\nSystems engineers and researchers, who would like to adapt TensorFlow Federated to target new types of environments, will learn how they can benefit from the abstract platform-independent representation used to represent all computations expressed in TFF - at its core, TFF is designed to facilitate a smooth migration path for all TFF code from a simulation environment to a possible future deployment on real devices in production.",

While I definitely missed some of Python\u2019s neat features and amazing standard library, I was very impressed by one thing in Go: its approach to parallelism. That is why in this workshop I want to give an example of how to build a highly parallel service in Go, from the perspective of someone that knows what it means to leave Python\u2019s niceness behind.\r\n\r\nI will start by giving you some motivation of why you might be tempted to even try Go, mostly by giving some technical background of how parallel execution works in Python versus how it works in Go. After being properly motivated, our actual programming will start simple: we will build our first API call in Go, including the infamous task of taking untyped JSON and putting it into a typed Go struct. Nothing parallel just yet.\r\n\r\nThe next step is the exciting part, as we will call two APIs in parallel, using channels and goroutines, Go\u2019s core language features for parallel execution. All this we will wrap in a nice _job_ abstraction, with a _start_ method, so we feel right at home as Python developers. To ward us against slow APIs we will then add a parallel timeout and stopping behavior.\r\n\r\nIn the description I promised you a service, so this is what we will do in the end. We will implemented a Go HTTP server that spawns a new goroutine for every request, which in turn will spawn a goroutine for each of our API calls. So much parallelism! But I promise you, this will not result in any headaches.",

Recent developments in electronics manufacturing, laser cutting, and 3D printing have allowed a community of keyboard makers to flourish and challenge the status quo. This talk will set out to upend preconceived notions of input, and will present alternative keyboard layouts, both virtual and physical.\r\n\r\nWe will start by covering the history of keyboard layouts, and how the physics of staggered keys created the standard QWERTY layout that we still use today. Next, we will move on to software-based alternate layouts that can be installed on existing computers, usually with minimal effort. We will then make the jump from bits and bytes to switches and diodes, exploring the way a keyboard works. Further, we will discuss microcontrollers used and developed by the keyboard community, and, finally, end on the open-source software used to program and configure these devices.  As a grace note we will see a demo of a custom-built keyboard using a PyBoard as a microcontroller.",

The official version was a \"Blazon\" - a precise, terse description in heraldic language. This heraldic language reads like English, Latin, French, and XML had a baby. It's a fully recursive language with a formal grammar, variable assignment, positional arguments, and also, Lions, Bears, and Pythons.\r\nHere's an example: Sable, on a fesse or three lions gules\r\nIn this talk, we look at parsing this Medieval Domain Specific Language with Python.

However, implementing such a model is usually not as straight-forward as importing a model from scikit-learn. Then there is also the question on how to pick the right prior and how to check if your model actually converged, both tasks that might seem daunting for anyone starting out with Bayesian modelling. In this talk, I will show the basic Bayesian workflow, starting with some guidelines on how to pick a fitting prior for your problem, how to check model convergence and how to do model comparison. To exemplify the workflow, I will use the real-world problem of predicting house prices in Berlin.\r\nFor the modelling, the Python package `PyMC3` is used and for visualization and model checking, the package `ArviZ` is used.",

In order to implement data products and bring them from prototype to production successfully there is though a lot of work happening behind the scenes. \r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on my personal experience of working as a product manager for a cross disciplinary data science team. I will follow a machine learning project from infancy to going live, focusing mainly on tips and tricks and lessons learned. For example, talking to stakeholders, understanding the problems they have and then translating that to actual data problems is not as trivial as it may seem. This is a talk about the challenges in tech and about the value of communication.",

Or in some cases, these variables are even manually programmed.\r\nThe different game experiences, like levels of difficulty, are usually achieved by truncating these distributions to increase the chances of obtaining a sample that translates in a particular game experience, for example, a harder game. In simple games, this is done commonly by just increasing the speed of the game, without changing the way these variables are sampled. All of these variables have an impact on the way the game is going to develop for the player. \r\n\r\nUsing Snake as an example, the goal of this tutorial is to instead of sampling the apple position from a uniform distribution, use a machine learning model trained on data from past games. By selecting different game situations to train our model we can archive different game experiences, such as different difficulty, game styles or even adapted to a player\u2019s style.",

Nonetheless, amid the public debate on this topic, social media (especially Facebook) sparked with hate speech against the LGBT community, with no consistent action to moderate it. \r\n\r\nOnline hate speech is nothing new, but the measures taken against it are mainly focused on English speakers. How might we make social media safer and more inclusive for minorities speaking languages other than English? In this talk I will discuss the steps undertaken to automatically detect hate speech in Romanian, starting from the content generated during the days preceding the afore-mentioned referendum. Currently, there is no public dataset for hate speech detection in Romanian so, in this talk, the process and learnings from collecting data to implementing a natural language processing (NLP) solution and possible extensions to other languages, will be discussed. Overall, this project explores how data science can be leveraged for social good.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, the year 2018 brought major breakthroughs for the NLP community, especially in transfer learning. Thus, we examine the capabilities of current tools for (cross-lingual) transfer learning and discuss the challenges and alternatives. Are pre-trained word embeddings enough to achieve good results in classifying Facebook comments as hateful/not-hateful, and if not, how can we leverage more powerful, pre-trained models? Some of the discussed techniques include::\r\n\r\n- TF-IDF representation\r\n- word2vec, fastText embeddings\r\n- Multilingual BERT, LASER, XLM \r\n\r\nDiffusion of hate speech needs to be tackled immediately, whether in Romanian or any other language. This talk will give pointers to the audience into how we can more effectively achieve this by exploring existing tools and methods for classification of Facebook comments into hateful/not-hateful and going forward from there.",

However, simulation techniques are commonly employed for speeding up the development process but are rarely utilised afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis talk answers the following question: How to couple the simulation model gathered in a digital twin and a machine learning predictive maintenance algorithm. By means of a simple technical system, a consistent model written in Modelica is proposed and supplied to a Python-based scikit-learn environment. Experimental data show the short-comings and advantages of either model.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the talk provides a workflow for this procedure and the results of digital twin, predictive maintenance algorithm, and experiments will highlight the points where to look closer at.\r\n\r\nThere are no special requirements to be able to follow the talk. Some basic Python would be beneficial. Modelica knowledge is not required. The digital twin model will be simple enough to be understood. Software to be used: Python 3, pandas, scikit-learn, jupyter-notebook, Modelica, OpenModelica, (gcc under the hood)",

As any other tool, event sourcing is not a silver bullet and it won't be portrayed as such - it has its drawbacks and introduces a fair amount of complexity.\r\n\r\nOnly small amount of code will be shown during the talk - and more to visualise the idea than to prescribe a specific implementation. These and all other topics will be backed by over three years of practice in designing, developing and running applications equipped with event-sourcing-based storage under production traffic - which, I believe, gave us enough real-life examples to showcase ES' strong sides and associated stumbling blocks.\r\n\r\nLast note: while these are strongly related topics, I will be only briefly mentioning DDD, CQRS and EDA and - ES will be the main focus.",

Victims of online misogyny experience a sense of fear and attack on their integrity. Amnesty International found that of the women who experienced abuse or harassment online, 41% of responding women felt that their physical safety was threatened and 1 in 2 women experienced lower self-esteem or loss of self-confidence as well as stress, anxiety or panic attacks. By pushing female-identifying people out of online spaces, because of fear of victimisation or retaliation, online misogyny punishes female-identifying people further by affecting their economic potential and political representation.  Many cannot rely on the internet for a living and in addition, the Chartered Institute of Marketers, UK reported that 83% of women had self-censored indicating that voicing a political opinion could be under threat. In a world that is more entrenched on the internet than ever, these human rights violations are contributing to an oppression similar to those of decades long gone.\r\n\r\nOpt Out's founding idea is a browser extension that removes misogynistic comments from an individual\u2019s social media feed. But what is online misogyny? How do you capture the nuances whilst ensuring that the richness of respectful online interaction is maintained? In this talk I will discuss:\r\n\r\n- How we generated our dataset - annotators, snorkel-metal\r\n- Our modeling techniques and architectures\r\n- Network - the influence of user profiles on classification\r\n- Our investigation into the syntactic structure of online misogyny\r\n\r\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has changed our lives online on social media platforms. We have the right to be forgotten, to see what is being collected about us and to opt out if we wish. The current abuse that female-identifying people suffer is not avoidable. We see Opt Out as an extension of the GDPR that also protects the human rights of these people online. These human rights are the right to security of person, non-discrimination, and the right to freedom of expression and opinion. Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, social media platforms have a specific responsibility to respect these human rights. While steps have been made to protect these people online, not enough has been done. Let\u2019s not let hate win, lets Opt Out.",

Each package uses different ways to change elements like axis features, labels, annotations, titles, or even gridlines. Even the way the input data needs to be structured can differ. As a result, the analyst is often absorbed more by figuring out how to adjust each visual detail, instead of thinking of the graphic as a system of logically structured elements, and mapping the data to each of them separately.\r\n\r\nEnter *The Grammar of Graphics*, a framework conceptualized by L. Wilkinson in 1999, which helps us better understand the underlying structure of every graphic. The talk will introduce the framework by deconstructing a simple chart into its constituent \"grammatical elements\": *Aesthetics, Algebra, Scales, Statistics, Geometry, and Coordinates*. I will discuss each and explain how every element directly translates to the decisions we take when designing a graphic. \r\n\r\nThen, I will practically demonstrate how plotting with a grammar can be highly liberating, as it makes otherwise complex plots easy to think about and then to create. Even though *The Grammar of Graphics* (and its sister *The Layered Grammar of Graphics*, Wickham 2010) is most famously implemented in R's `ggplot2`, that doesn't mean the framework is language-specific \u2013 it can be used with any Python visualization package. To demonstrate, I will show an application of the framework by building a chart in the Python `plotnine` package, and then explaining how we can use *the grammar* as a guide to let us build the same chart in `matplotlib` \u2013 one grammatical element at a time.",

Therefore, the potential is vast, what open resources can offer us to become masters of our own sound experience. People who are deaf could build apps to alarm them if cars honk, and from which direction; people with intact hearing could build a filter that lets them hear only birds sing, if they tire of human voices. Smart filters can potentially reduce hearing loss as well as stress for those living or working in noisy environments. \r\n\r\nThe problem potential developers and users of smart filtering techniques face is the large number of barriers standing in front of them. Often access to the relevant resources, such as  hardware, software, and data (e.g. for training neural networks), either require a hefty fee, a good health insurance, an amazing employer, or a position at a successful academic or research institution. Furthermore, the mathematics behind that of sound, specifically digital signal processing, as well as deep learning algorithms can be quite intimidating and difficult to penetrate for outsiders.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we share what we\u2019ve learned building a <a href=\"https://github.com/pgys/NoIze\">low-computational smart noise filter</a> for the purpose of speech enhancement via mobile device (e.g. smart phone). We will offer an overview of how we used Python to create not only a functional smart noise filter, but a potential learning tool to help others understand and interact with the math behind it. Important topics will include the gray area of \u2018high performance\u2019 in deep learning as well as acoustic filtering. We will also talk about the pros and cons of using open audio databases and how people can contribute to them to increase their already great value.",
