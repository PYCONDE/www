This year, **PyLadies Hamburg, PyLadies Berlin & Friends are joining forces to organise a beginner Internet-of-Things (IOT) workshop**, on the first day of the Sprints: Saturday, October 12th, 10:00 - 18:00 at the Sprint Venue.

In this workshop we will learn more about micro-controllers, data manipulation and the Python ecosystem. We will start by setting up a Raspberry Pi, then collecting weather data and finally visualizing this data. With the collected data, the aim in the future is to predict the temperature in your flat.

So what we will do:
- Hook up DHT22 humidity and temperature sensor with a Raspberry Pi
- Set up a hobby database
- Build an app to read sensor data and store it to a data source
- Read the data and visualize it in a grafana dashboard
- Predict temperature based on historical data

What you need to bring:
- a laptop
- your GitHub account. Create one, if you do not have one already.
- micro sd  to usb adapter
- other material will be available on site

**The workshop is for those identifying as women or non binary and want to learn how to build a hobby project from scratch involving various tools.**

As we only have a few places at the workshop we ask everybody who wants to participate to fill out the [form](https://forms.gle/x7c85EGvjgYQxXzC6).

The application will close once the pool of participants is filled.
