After last year's huge success - being sold out two months in advance,
having 1111 attendees at the conference and 800 more on the waiting list - we decided to go to a bigger venue.

As of now the conference will feature five talks tracks and more than 100 sessions:
Two tracks dedicated exclusively to PyData topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering.
Two tracks for Python topics such as programming, DevOps, Web, Django.
One for general topics such as Ethics, best practices and community.
