After last year's huge success - being sold out two months in advance,
having 1111 attendees at the conference and 800 more on the waiting list - we decided to go to a bigger venue.

Two tracks dedicated exclusively to PyData topics as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Engineering.
Two tracks for Python topics as programming, DevOps, Web, Django.
One for general topics as Ethics, best practices and community.
