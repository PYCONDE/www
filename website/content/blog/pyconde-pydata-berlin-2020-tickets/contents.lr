As in previous years there are different types of tickets:

#### Business Tickets
For company purchases and if you make a living as a freelancer at least partly from using Python. Company name will be printed on badges. In case you plan to register multiple employees, consider one of our [sponsoring packages incl. tickets](https://de.pycon.org/static/files/sponsoringinformation.pdf).

- Regular:	550 €
- Late Bird:	650 €

#### Individual Tickets
You are paying for yourself without making a living with Python (e.g. as freelancer). Access to talks and tutorials. Company name will NOT be printed on badge. Unfortunately, since we have seen misuse in past years here, ticket purchases will be reviewed.

#### Childcare Tickets
We are excited to announce that we will offer all-day childcare at the venue.
During the conference hours and during the sprints, there will be a dedicated area with childcare professionals who will look after your children.
Spots are limited, please get a ticket to reserve a spot.

The ticket sale will open on
> Monday April 29 12:00 CEST.

150 Early Bird tickets are available, sold on a first-come-first-served basis. Early Bird ticket purchases are limited to two tickets per entity.

Unfortunately we can not run the conference in a (semi-)publicly-owned — and therefore cheaper — venue this year. Furthermore we are looking to make some profit to support Open Source and diversity projects via NumFocus and the Python Software Verband.
Please keep in mind organisers and volunteers contribute a lot of their free time to make this conference happen and affordable compared to other non-community, non expert-for-expert run conferences.

If you have questions regarding ticket purchases, please [see our FAQ first](https://de.pycon.org/frequently-asked-questions/#tickets).
