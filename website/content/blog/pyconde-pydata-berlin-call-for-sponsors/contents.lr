The PyCon.DE & PyData Berlin 2020 is knocking on the door and the preparing is running at full speed!

Many of you may still have good and bright memories of the PyCon.DE in Karlsruhe or PyData in Berlin 2018.

Because of that, one more time we want to thank our sponsors of the last PyCon.DE Karlsruhe and PyData Berlin who helped to make the conferences a huge success.

We welcomed at each conference over 500 attendees from all over the world, with dozens of talks, tutorials and hands on sessions.

*For the PyCon.DE & PyData Berlin 2020 we’re happy to have a collaboration of both conferences and we calculate up to 1000 participants and plan a great ensemble of talks and workshops.*

The Python Software Foundation is significantly just with the great support of our PyCon and PyData sponsors able to improve the Python community worldwide by promoting sprints, meetups, events, projects, the Python Ambassador Program and much more – and in this case the PyCon.DE & PyData Berlin 2020.

Your sponsorship helps keep PyCon.DE & PyData Berlin affordable and accessible to a wide and diverse audience.

- visibility to potential new customers and/or employees
