I am a business intelligence analyst for the non-profit betterplace.org and help the organisation to make data driven decisions. Before moving to Berlin in 2016 I held several analytical roles in Germany, Italy and the UK.

At these events we offer non-profits and social businesses the opportunity to meet data scientists and analysts to discuss various data questions and challenges.

body: Algorithms and machine learning techniques are mostly used by leading companies to boost profits and to please shareholders but they are also applied by nonprofit organisations to improve the world, from battling social inequalities to advocating for intercultural tolerance and more. However, most social change organisations lack the necessary financial resources to employ highly qualified data scientists. On the other hand, many data scientists are willing to dedicate some spare time to do something meaningful. Data Science for Social Good Berlin acts as an intermediary to connect data scientists and nonprofits to address the social issues of our time. Several event formats are used to help nonprofits with small and large data projects. 
In this talk, we will present DSSG Berlin, its mission, its working structure as a nonprofit organisation itself, and the different events we are running. We will give you an idea of the nonprofits we work with as well as the various kinds of problems these organisations face. We will show you how past projects created a real impact and how nonprofit organisations have already profited from the extraordinary commitment and dedication of Berlin’s data science community.
