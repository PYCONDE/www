body: This presentation is an extended (and updated!) version of the [lightning talk given at the PyData Berlin Meetup (December 2018)](https://github.com/jtpio/10-minutes-10-jlab-extensions).

JupyterLab extensions greatly improve the user experience when it comes to working with Jupyter Notebook and Data Science workflows. The extension mechanism lets third-party developers write their own extensions and contribute back to the Jupyter ecosystem.

There is now a growing number of these extensions which provide IDE-like features such as: git integration, code formatting, table of content, diagram editor, and many more.

The goal of this presentation is to complement the online documentation by doing a demo of a curated list of these JupyterLab extensions. All happening in JupyterLab.

Layout:

- Introduction to JupyterLab extensions: what are they and why are they useful? [5 min]
- Demo of 20 JupyterLab extensions in 20 minutes [20 min]
- What's next and questions? [5 min]

There will also be a GitHub repository with all the dependencies and extensions, ready to be tried out right away on [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
