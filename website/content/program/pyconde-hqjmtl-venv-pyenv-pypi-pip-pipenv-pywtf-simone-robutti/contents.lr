body: The goal of this talk is to cover the most common Python Project tools and explain where and why they should be used. Hopefully it will give a clearer picture of what you really need to build and manage your projects, alongside a better understanding of the many tools you often have to use when employing or contributing to an open source Python project. 

The talk will cover tools for:

* building and distributing
* testing
* managing packages
* linting and analysing your code
