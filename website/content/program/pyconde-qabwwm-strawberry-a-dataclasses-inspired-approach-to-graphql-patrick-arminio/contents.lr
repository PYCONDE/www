body: Over the past few years, GraphQL has gained much traction, especially in the JavaScript world. Python is getting on board this trend with new interesting libraries. In this talk, we will see how Strawberry makes uses of dataclasses and type hints to easily create GraphQL APIs.

There’s going to be a recap of the current GraphQL libraries available for Python, what are pro and cons and which one is the best for Django. Then there’s going to be a deep dive of Strawberry, a new GraphQL library that makes uses of dataclasses and type hints.
