body: Docker provides tooling for building,
running and communication between Linux containers. Containers are a lightweight 
alternative to virtual machines and are a great way of isolating resources
and preventing dependency conflicts in software. The basic concepts and pros
and cons of containerization will be discussed. 

This talk will show how to build and ship a Python application (flask web app)
with Docker and why this is beneficial compared to running it directly on the
machine. Docker also provides an official SDK / API for Python which can be used
alongside Pytest for writing integration and end to end tests for Docker containers
which will be shown for an example application.
