body: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the most widely used general purpose machine learning library in Python. It has a very nice API and many tools are built around it, but its support for neural networks is very limited.

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a deep learning platform that makes working with neural networks a blast. However, users often find that they need to write boilerplate and wrapper code to integrate PyTorch into their existing workflows.

A possible solution to those problems is [skorch](https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch). This open source Python library allows you to easily wrap your PyTorch modules to give them a high level sklearn API. This allows you to:

* tap into the power and flexibility of PyTorch
* get rid of most of the boring boilerplate code
* combine PyTorch nets with the usual sklearn goodies like `Pipeline`s, `GridSearchCV`, etc.

Ideally, you already have some basic knowledge of sklearn and PyTorch, or are an advanced user of one of the two libraries who is curious about improving your workflow.
