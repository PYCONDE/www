body: This 30-minute talk will give you an overview about project management, success factors and specialties within enterprises. This will be a guide how you promote internal projects and bring them to success within a highly "political" environment.

Often developers feel misunderstood while managers are overwhelmed with technical details.
In this talk I'll present how both world can get a better understanding with each other to collaborate better - and without the pains.

Details:
Introduction to project management
Success Factors                		
                Be quick but patient                		
		Get your things done and be aware what will happen next
		Communicate Clear		
		Go step-by-step
		Does the Management method matter?		
Internal Selling
                Find a sponsor
                Define the Stakeholders and tell them what they can expect
                Not the Code matters, the value matters
Distinctive features
Stakeholder Management
Use Case
