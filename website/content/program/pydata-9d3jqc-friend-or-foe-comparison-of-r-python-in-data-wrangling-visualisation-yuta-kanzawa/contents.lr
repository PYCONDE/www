body: R and Python have differences as many as simiralities. Through their comparisons, we can understand both languages better and use them effectively. I will take a look at some examples from de facto standard packages such as tidyverse and pandas for data munging tasks, and ggplot2 and matplotlib (and seaborn) for data visualisation.

1. Differences between R and Python as Language
    * Procedural and object-oriented programming
    * Specific and general purpose

2. Data Wrangling
    * tidyverse
    * pandas

3. Data Visualisation
    * ggplot2
    * matplotlib
    * plotly

4. Some Other Cases (depending on time and interest)
    * Machine learning
    * Deep learning
    * Big data (distributed data processing)
    * Natural language processing

5. Conclusion
    * To be bilingual
