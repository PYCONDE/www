#### Who's behind this conference?

As almost all Python and PyData conferences this event is run and organised by volunteers contributing free time and supported by community sponsors contributing work time of their employees. Any conference profits will go back to the community and Open Source via the Python Softwareverband e. V. and NumFocus.

#### What can I do to support?

Lighten our communication load:
 - check this FAQ page for answers first
 - read our update emails (check your spam),
 - be proactive and try to find answers by googling or via our community channels as:
   - the open [Telegram group](https://t.me/pyconde)
   - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyconde)
   - check [Important Dates](#important-dates) for updates

Sign up as a volunteer. More information coming soon.

Once tickets are sold out, please do refrain from sending emails to help desk if there was "something we could do", we can not.
Thanks for your kind understanding we probably won't answer. :)
