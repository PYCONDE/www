#### How much are the tickets?

Ticket prices are expected to be similar [as in 2019](https://2019.pycon.de/blog/pyconde-pydata-berlin-2019-tickets/) but we  have to confirm still.

All ticket prices include 19% VAT. [European regulations](https://ep2016.europython.eu/admin/cms/page/edit-plugin/240/#) define that
conferences are taxable in the country where the conference takes place, so the EU VAT reverse charging mechanism cannot be applied.
However companies can easily apply for a VAT refund from the authorities.

#### Are tickets refundable?

We expect tickets to be refundable until Jan 31st 2022 at least in part. Though this will require further investigation as the world has changed since 2019. No refunds after Jan 31st.
You may re-assign the ticket to someone else if you cannot make it or donate it to the financial aid programme.
