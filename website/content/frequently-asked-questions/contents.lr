#### Who's behind this conference?

As almost all Python and PyData conferences this event is run and organised by volunteers contributing free time and supported by community sponsors contributing work time of their employees. Any conference profits will go back to the community and Open Source via the Python Softwareverband e. V. and NumFocus.

#### What can I do to support?
