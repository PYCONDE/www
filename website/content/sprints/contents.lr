### What is a “Sprint” ?

Most Open Source software is created by multiple persons remotely.
At Sprints the developers meet in person to work on OSS together.
Other communities call a Sprint "Hackathon".

As conference we are happy to provide a platform where maintainers and developers of Open Source in Python  / PyData can meet.

We will have a "Sprint Orientation" session on Friday afternoon at Kosmos.
In this session the organisers of a sprint present what they plan to sprint on.
If you want to join a sprint team, please attend this session.
