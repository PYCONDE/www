body:

We decided not to have an app after all.
We looked into multiple apps and none of them seemed very suitable in the end (more below).

##### App for next year
All apps we looked into was lacking of at least one of the below, so if you know of any conference app that:
- is suitable for Android and iOS
- fully integratable via an API incl. updates
- fully GDPR compliant
- cool

do let us know!
