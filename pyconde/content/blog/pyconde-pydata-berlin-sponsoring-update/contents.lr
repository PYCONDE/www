That’s just awesome!

Many sponsoring packages are sold out already.
There are still Silver sponsoring packages available, so if you are interested in being part of the conference,

Here are just some of the benefits from being a silver sponsor:

 - elevating and establishing your corporate identity within the community
 - present your services or products to expectedly 1000 attendees
