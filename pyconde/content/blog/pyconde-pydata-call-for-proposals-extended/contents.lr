The Call for Proposals ended last Sunday.
We do have received many great proposals for talks and tutorials.
Thanks to all the submitters - great work!

Though many seem to have missed the deadline due to sunny weather, elections,â€¦.

The program work group has decided to extend the call for a few more days until

> Sunday 9 June 23:59:59 UTC

We are also planning to introduce a user voting this year and are just working on setting everything up.
We'll keep you posted on the proceedings.

To submit: Please go to our [Pretalx website](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-berlin-2019/cfp) to submit your proposals.
You will need to setup an account there (can be deleted by you anytime), you can edit your proposals until the CfP closes.
