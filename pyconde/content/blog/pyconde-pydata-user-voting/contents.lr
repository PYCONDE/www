We are happy to announce the first ever user voting for a PyConDE and PyData conference.
It's important for us to see what the community is interested to see at the conference.

The voting is open until July 7.

### Guiding Principles
We want to provide a user voting
- open to the community
- gives the community a voice in making the conference program
- unbiased, speaker names are not displayed on the voting site
- robust against fraud as setting up multiple identies for voting reasons
- crowdsource work to leift workload from organisers contributing their free time

### Who Can Participate?
To cast votes one requires an email address we know , i.e. has been used for:
 - attending one of the past conferences PyData Berlin 2018, PyConDE 2018/17/16
 - submitting a talk in 2019
 - registering for interest on the ticket page

 If you can't rememeber the email address you used or are new to the community,
 we need to set you up, please sign up [via this Google form](https://forms.gle/8Z1cFbzLMqamJFDr8).
 We'll reach out once we have reviewed your application, this may at least take 24 hours.

### How Talk Voting Works
The voting system allows only for positive votes, i.e. there is no way of downvoting proposals by giving them a bad rating.
The system keeps track of your previous votes and you may change them anytime until the end of the voting.
Votes are automatically saved once you hit the button.

You may vote:
- Must See
- Want to See
- Maybe
- Not Interested
- No vote

If you have any additional comments, please add them in the text field and click on 'submit comment'.

You may also filter for formats or talks you have not voted or voted for so far.


### Talk Selection
The voting is supposed to have a huge impact on the selection though the final talk selection is up to the program commitee.
We believe a good conference is made of popular talks as well as new or niche topics - all by and for our diverse community.
