We are happy to announce that the two conferences PyConDE and PyData Berlin will team up for 2019.
After a few meetings both conference teams feel that the conferences goals and spirits align very well and teaming up we can build a better, bigger conference than apart.

The main conference will be held from October 9 to 11 at Kosmos, Berlin followed by two days of sprints. We are expecting up to 1000 participants.

The conference will feature seven tutorials and talks tracks and more than 100 sessions:
Three dedicated exclusively to PyData topics as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Ethics
Three for Python topics as programming, DevOps, Web, Django.
Plenary for keynotes as well as PyData and PyConDE sessions.

PyConDE is the German conference for the Python language and was established in 2011. Last year's conference had 550 participants and sold out one month before the event.

PyData Berlin was established in 2014 and hosts monthly meetups and a yearly conference about Python, Data and everything in between. It is one of the biggest PyData chapters and the Pydata Berlin conference keeps on growing every year with a record of 600 attendees in the 2018 conference.

We wish to keep the individual identities of PyData Berlin and PyconDE, but please prepare to some changes regarding the operation of the conference with respect to previous years. Both teams had to adapt in order to promise a smooth collaboration and we are certain that we will have a great event.


The conference is organised by experts for other experts providing an excellent quality level of content. It is run by volunteers from the community. All profits will be redistributed to the community supporting Open Source and diversity.

The conference is run under the roof of the German Python Softwareverband (link) and NumFocus (link).
