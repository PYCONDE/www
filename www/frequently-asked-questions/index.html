<h4>I have updated some information -  but it does not reflect on the website.</h4>
<p>We use a static website. All information is coming from Pretalx. The website updated approx. once a day. Please be patient.<br>
The same applies for the speaker list on Twitter.<br>
Please do not write to help desk to request information changes, it's self-service, thank you.</p>
<h4>What about internet during my talk?</h4>

<h3 id="tickets">Tickets</h3><h4>What is the right ticket to buy?</h4>
<p>Companies and freelancers must buy company tickets. No exceptions.
Reduced tickets are available for students, post-docs, academic researchers, hobbyists, enthusiasts and people just learning the language.</p>
<h4>Tickets are sold out.</h4>
<p>If you are interested in getting a ticket please do sign up for the waiting list on the ticket page.<br>
Please sign up only <strong>once</strong>.<br>
Note: you will <strong>not</strong> receive an additional  confirmation by email you signed up for the waiting list, our provider Tito lacks this feature.</p>
<h4>I signed up the waiting list - when will I get notified?</h4>
<p>If tickets become available due to cancellations received we will offer these tickets for sale to people on the waiting list.  These offers are only valid for a few hours and are FIFO (first come-first served) - watch your inboxes!</p>
<h4>How likely is it I may bet a ticket via the waiting list.</h4>
<p>"Predictions are hard, especially about the future."<br>
The waiting list is not a waiting line, we offer tickets to anyone on the list no matter when you signed up.</p>
<h4>Will it be helpful if I write you an email explaining why I missed buying a ticket.</h4>
<p>We feel with you! Though we will ignore any requests like this. There is always a next year.</p>
<h4>What about student tickets?</h4>
<p>Students must present a valid student ID at the conference. If you are a student or will be a student while the conference is running you are eligible for one student ticket. In case you are a student now but won't be a student in October we cannot offer you a student ticket.</p>
<h4>I'm on a budget and cannot afford a ticket.</h4>
<p>Please have a look at our financial aid and scholarship program. The program will open February, 19 and close June, 1. Please check back our <a href="/financial-aid/">Financial Aid Programme page</a> for more details.</p>
<h4>Is it possible to purchase Individual tickets as a company?</h4>
<p>No</p>
<h4>Is it possible to purchase Student tickets as a company?</h4>
<p>Yes, the attendee must present a valid student ID to enter the conference.</p>
<h4>I'm an academic researcher, which one is the right ticket for me?</h4>
