            <h3>Terms &amp; Conditions</h3>
<p>These Terms and Conditions apply to all attendees who have registered for PyCon DE &amp; PyData Berlin.</p>
<h5>Registration</h5>
<p>Registering for the event does not guarantee your ticket until it has been paid for in full. So to secure your ticket, you must pay the registration invoice as soon as possible.</p>
<h5>Cancellation Policy</h5>
<p>All ticket sales are final but you may assign the ticket to anyone else before the conference.</p>
<h5>Code of Conduct</h5>
<p>Python is a diverse community who maintains a reputation as a friendly, welcoming, inspiring and dynamic group. We’d like to keep it that way, which is why we ask all attendees, organizers and sponsors to follow this code of conduct (CoC) as set out here: <a href="https://de.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/">https://de.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/</a></p>

<p>Speakers are asked to submit additional personal information, part of which will become public (eg: bio).
